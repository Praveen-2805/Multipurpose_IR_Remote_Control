## Introduction

The Multipurpose IR Remote project aims to provide a flexible and customizable remote control system using the ESP32 microcontroller. With the ESP32's built-in IR capabilities, the project allows users to control various electronic devices, such as TVs, DVD players, air conditioners, and more, all from a single remote control.

The system captures and stores the IR codes from different remote controls, mapping them to specific functions that can be triggered by the ESP32-based remote control. By leveraging the ESP32's Wi-Fi capabilities, the project can also integrate with other IoT devices and platforms for enhanced functionality.

## Hardware Requirements

To build the Multipurpose IR Remote using ESP32, you will need the following components:

- ESP32 development board (e.g., ESP32 NodeMCU)
- Breadboard or perfboard
- IR receiver module (e.g., TSOP38238)
- IR LED
- Resistors (220Ω and 10kΩ)
- Pushbuttons (for user input)
- Jumper wires

## Software Requirements

The following software tools are required for setting up the project:

- Arduino IDE (Integrated Development Environment)
- ESP32 board support package for Arduino IDE
- IRremoteESP8266 library for Arduino
- [Optional] Git (for version control)

## Circuit Diagram

Insert a detailed circuit diagram illustrating the connections between the components. Clearly indicate the pin assignments for the ESP32 board, IR receiver module, and IR LED. You may use software like Fritzing or draw the circuit diagram manually.

## Installation

1. Connect the components according to the circuit diagram.
2. Install the Arduino IDE by following the official instructions for your operating system.
3. Install the ESP32 board support package in the Arduino IDE:
   - Open the Arduino IDE.
   - Navigate to **File > Preferences**.
   - In the "Additional Boards Manager URLs" field, enter the following URL:
     ```
     https://dl.espressif.com/dl/package_esp32_index.json
     ```
   - Click the "OK" button to save the preferences.
   - Navigate to **Tools > Board > Boards Manager**.
   - Search for "esp32" and click on the board package from Espressif Systems.
   - Click the "Install" button to install the package.
4. Install the IRremoteESP8266 library in the Arduino IDE:
   - Open the Arduino IDE.
   - Navigate to **Sketch > Include Library > Manage Libraries**.
   - Search for "IRremoteESP8266" and click on the library from the results.
   - Click the "Install" button to install the library.
5. Clone or download the project code from the repository.
   - If using Git, run the following command:
     ```
     git clone <repository-url>
     ```
   - Alternatively, download the code as a ZIP file and extract it to a local directory.

## Usage

1. Connect the ESP32 board to your computer using a USB cable.
2. Open the Arduino IDE and navigate to the

 project folder.
3. Open the `IR_Remote_Control.ino` file.
4. Set up the Wi-Fi credentials and modify any other necessary settings in the code.
5. Verify and upload the sketch to the ESP32 board.
6. Once uploaded, open the serial monitor to view the output.
7. Point the ESP32-based remote control towards the device you want to control.
8. Press the appropriate buttons to trigger the corresponding functions.
9. Monitor the serial output for feedback and debugging information.
